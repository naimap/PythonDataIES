 # Prerequisities

 The course is designed for students that have at least some basic coding experience. It does not need to be very advanced, but they should be aware of concepts such as ` for ` loop ,`if` and `else`,`variable` or `function`.

 No knowledge of Python is required for entering the course.

 # Credits
 Passing the course is rewarded with 5 ECTS credits.
